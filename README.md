# Autonomous Agents and Steering Behaviors Simulation

This project focuses on simulating autonomous agents with "natural" behavior and improvisation capabilities, akin to human-like qualities. Autonomous agents bridge aspects of robots and human characteristics, with a wide range of applications. Here it is explored the representation or simulation of movement, specifically focusing on Steering Behaviors.

## Technologies Used:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the simulation.
- **Pygame**: Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionality for creating graphics, handling user input, and managing game states.
- **NumPy**: It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is used for various calculations and operations within the simulation.

## Installation 

To run the simulation, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    
2. **Install Pygame and NumPy**: 

   ```
   pip install pygame
   pip install numpy
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: Navigate to the directory containing the scripts in your terminal or command prompt and execute the script using Python:

   ```
   python flock.py
   ```

   ```
   python autonomousAgents.py
   ```

## Usage

- Upon running the script, a Pygame window will open displaying the simulation environment.
- Follow the instructions within the simulation to interact with and observe the behavior of autonomous agents.
- Experiment with different parameters and behaviors to observe their effects on the agents movements.
